# Microsoft-Azure-Cloud-Services
Azure fundamentals and concepts

This notes is my personal understanding of the AZ-900 course.
This is useful for people who are trying to understand basic Azure concepts and trying to participate for AZ-900 certificate exam.

People with no prior clouding knowledge or no idea of basic Azure concepts can start with this course. This is where we begin the journey in the cloud.
Concepts covered:
> Cloud Concepts
> Core Azure Services
> Security, Privacy, Compliance and trust
> Azure pricing and support

Study Areas: (Useful inforamtion for People who are trying for Azure certificate)
Describe Cloud Concepts (15 to 20%)
Describe core Azure Services (30-35%)
Describe Security, Privacy, Compliance and trust(25-30%)
Describe Azure pricing and support(20-25%)


* Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

Basically, it is a delivery model for services like storage(databases), compute power (linux, mac, windows), networking, analytics.

Key Characterstics of Cloud:
> Scalability: It is a process of adding or removing resources
> Elasticity: ability of system to scale dynamically
> Agility: the ability to react quickly (allocate and deallocate resources)
> Fault tolerance: ability of system to remian up and running during component and service failures
> Disaster Recovery: creating 2 copies of application (system ability to recover from any unexpected disaster)
> High Availability: High availability is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.


* Principles of Economics of Scale

  This will explain the cost of Azure.
  > Cost per unit(service) lowers as the company grows Due to increase in efficiency)


* Capital and Operational Expenditures

  Expenditure is an action of spending your company funds.

  CapEX means :
  > Own Infrasturcture
  > Big initial investment
  > Lots of maintenance is required

  OPEx maens:
  > Renting Infrasturcture (Cloud perfectly fits)
  > No initial investment, pay for what you use.
  > Minimal maintenance (mostly handled by cloud providers)

* Consumption Based Cloud model
 
  Key Characterstics:
  > No upfront costs 
  > No wasted resources
  > Pay for additional resources when needed
  > stop paying at anytime
  > Multiple pricing components per service
  > very granular usage measurement

* Cloud Service Models (Iaas v/s Paas v/s Saas)

  Infrastructure as Service (IaaS):
  All the layers that are directly related to the hardware ( virtualization, servers, networking, storage)

  Platform as Service (PaaS):
  All the software required to run the application (Runtime, middleware, OS)

  Software as Service(Saas):
  Application and data is software layer
